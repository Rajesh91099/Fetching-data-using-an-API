# Fetching-data-using-an-API
Fetched data from The Movie Database(TMDB) website using API. First I have imported pandas and requests libraries and used 'get' function in requests library to fetch data from that website in JSON format then I created a dataframe and fetched data of selected columns from json text and inserted in dataframe and finally saved it as csv.
